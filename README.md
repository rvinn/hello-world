# hello-world

I'm a newbe here as i study prototyping and HTML.

After 36 years of starting and building a small sign company in Show Low, AZ I finally decided to pursue web design. I'd already built an HTML/PHP site in early 2000 with the help of a real programmer that drastically need an upgrade. Currently, I've updated my site to a Wordpress site.
